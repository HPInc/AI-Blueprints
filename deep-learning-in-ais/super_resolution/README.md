 ## 1. Project Setup on AI Studio
 ---
 For this experiment, **we highly recommend yo to create a custom workspace on AI Studio using the Deep Learning GPU-based image**. 

 For extra libraries and specific versions, you can download our [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and direclty upload it on the Add Python Libraries field.
 
 For the memory configurations, you should set **at least 4GB for GPU RAM and 2 for GPU VRAM.**

This experiment requires the DIV2K dataset to run, that should be downloaded from s3://dsp-demo-bucket/div2k-data into an assset called DIV2K.
