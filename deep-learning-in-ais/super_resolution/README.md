 ## 1. Project Setup on AI Studio
 ---
 For this experiment, **we highly recommend yo to create a custom workspace on AI Studio using the Deep Learning GPU-based image**. 
 
 For the memory requirements, we suggest to have **at least 4GB of RAM, as well as 4GB for GPU dedicated RAM.**

 Similar configurations for a CPU-only experiment will work, but we do not recommend due to the excessive training time.

This experiment requires the DIV2K dataset to run, that should be downloaded from s3://dsp-demo-bucket/div2k-data into an assset called DIV2K.
