# Overview  
This repository contains a single integrated pipeline—**Agentic RAG for AI Studio with TRT-LLM and LangGraph**—that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow using:

- **TensorRT-backed Llama-3.1-Nano (TRT-LLM)**: for fast, GPU-accelerated inference.
- **LangGraph**: to orchestrate an agentic, multi-step decision flow (relevance check, memory lookup, query rewriting, retrieval, answer generation, and memory update).
- **ChromaDB**: as a local vector store over Markdown context files (about AI Studio).
- **SimpleKVMemory**: a lightweight on-disk key-value store to cache query-answer pairs.

# Setup  

### Step 0: Minimum Hardware Requirements
To ensure smooth execution and reliable model deployment, make sure your system meets the following minimum hardware specifications:

- GPU: NVIDIA GPU with at least 32 GB VRAM (for TensorRT-LLM engine)

- RAM: ≥ 64 GB system memory

- Disk: ≥ 32 GB free

- CUDA: Compatible CUDA toolkit (11.8 or 12.x) installed on your system

### Step 1: Create an AI Studio Project  
1. Create a **New Project** in AI Studio.   

### Step 2: Create a Workspace  
1. Select **NeMo Framework (version 25.04)** as the base image.    
2. To use this specific image version in AI Studio, add the following two lines to your `config.yaml` file located in `C:\Users\<user-name>\AppData\Local\HP\AIStudio` on Windows (or the corresponding directory on Ubuntu):
   
   ```
   ngcconfig:
	   nemoversionpin: "25.04"
   ```  
   
### Step 3: Verify Project Files  
1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HPInc/AI-Blueprints.git
   ```  
3. Navigate to `generative-ai/agentic_rag_with_trt-llm_and_langgraph` to ensure all files are cloned correctly after workspace creation.
