## Setup

### Step 0: Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth dashboard rendering and cuDF performance:

- RAM: 16 GB
- VRAM: 4 GB
- GPU: NVIDIA GPU

### Step 1: Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### Step 2: Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **NeMo Framework** as the base image.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

```bash
https://github.com/HPInc/AI-Blueprints.git
```

- Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

### Step 4: Add Project Assets

1. Add the **Bertlargeuncased** (not **BertLargeUncasedForNemo**) model from the model catalog in AI Studio to your workspace. Use the `datafabric` folder inside the workspace to work with this model.

### Step 5: Use a Custom Kernel for Notebooks

1. In Jupyter notebooks, select the **aistudio kernel** to ensure compatibility.

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate Embeddings

Run the following notebook to generate word embeddings and save the tokenizer:

- `run-workflow.ipynb`.

### Step 2: Deploy the Service

1. Only after running the 'run-workflow' notebook, execute the `register-model.ipynb` to register the BERT model in MLflow and create the API logic.
2. Navigate to **Deployments > New Service** in AI Studio.
3. Name the service and select the registered model.
4. Choose an available model version and configure it with **GPU acceleration**.
5. Start the deployment.
6. Once deployed, click on the **Service URL** to access the Swagger API page.
7. At the top of the Swagger API page, follow the provided link to open the demo UI for interacting with the locally deployed BERT model.
8. Enter a search query (e.g., _"Suggest a budget-friendly resort vacation."_).
9. Click **Get Recommendations** to view the results.

The model here can also be exported in ONNX format alongside the MLflow pyfunc format. For more details, please refer to the ONNX-README in the docs folder.

### Step 3: Launch the Streamlit Web App

1. After completing the local deployment, open the Streamlit web app using the deployment URL provided by AI Studio.
2. For additional details on how the Streamlit app works, refer to the `README.md` file in the `demo/streamlit` folder.
