## ⚙️ Setup

### Step 0: Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth image classification performance:

- **RAM**: 16 GB  
- **VRAM**: 4 GB  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU

### Step 1: Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### Step 2: Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **Data Science** as the base image.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

```bash
https://github.com/HPInc/aistudio-samples.git
```

- Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

## 🚀 Usage

### Step 1: Run the Notebook

Execute the notebook inside the `notebooks` folder:

```bash
notebooks/Iris flowers classification.ipynb
```

This will:

- Load and prepare the data
- Create the model architecture  
- Train the model
- Make inference
