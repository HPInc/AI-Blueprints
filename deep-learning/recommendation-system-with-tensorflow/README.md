# Overview

This project builds a simple **recommender system** for movies using **TensorFlow**.
It trains on user-item interaction data to predict movie preferences with Model-based Collaborative Filtering.

# Setup

### Step 0 ▪ Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth image classification performance:

- **RAM**: 16 GB
- **VRAM**: 4 GB
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU

### Step 1 ▪ Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### Step 2 ▪ Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **Deep Learning** as the base image.

### Step 3 ▪ Download the Dataset

- Download the `tutorial_data dataset`

  - **Asset Name**: `tutorial`
  - **Source**: `AWS S3`
  - **S3 URI**: `s3://dsp-demo-bucket/tutorial_data/`
  - **Resource Type**: `public`
  - **Bucket Region**: `us-west-2`

- Make sure that the dataset is in the datafabric folder inside your workspace. If the dataset does not appear after downloading, please restart your workspace.

### Step 4: Clone the Repository

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HPInc/AI-Blueprints.git
   ```

2. Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

---

# Usage

### 1 ▪ Run the Notebook

Execute the notebook inside the `notebooks` folder:

```bash
run-workflow.ipynb
```

This will:

- Load and prepare the data
- Create the model architecture
- Train the model
- Make inference

### 2 ▪ Run the Notebook

Execute the notebook inside the `notebooks` folder:

```bash
register-model.ipynb
```

This will:

- Log Model to MLflow
- Fetch the Latest Model Version from MLflow
- Load the Model and Run Inference

### 3 ▪ Deploy the Movie Recommendation Agent Service

- Go to **Deployments > New Service** in AI Studio.
- Name the service and select the registered model.
- Choose a model version and **GPU** it's **not necessary**.
- Choose the workspace.
- Start the deployment.
- Note: This is a local deployment running on your machine. As a result, if API processing takes more than a few minutes, it may return a timeout error. If you need to work with inputs that require longer processing times, we recommend using the provided notebook in the project files instead of accessing the API via Swagger or the web app UI.

### 4 ▪ Swagger / raw API

Once deployed, access the **Swagger UI** via the Service URL.

Paste a payload like:

```
{
  "inputs": {
    "movie_id": [
      2
    ],
    "rating": [
      2.5
    ]
  },
  "params": {}
}
```

And as response:

```
{
  "predictions": [
    [
      "Á köldum klaka (Cold Fever) (1994)",
      4.699822846736677
    ],
    [
      "unknown",
      3.8581945760877083
    ],
    [
      "Zeus and Roxanne (1997)",
      4.688325397321824
    ],
    [
      "Young Poisoner's Handbook, The (1995)",
      4.251002418730941
    ],
    [
      "Young Guns II (1990)",
      1.958771868681974
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Step 5: Launch the Streamlit Web App

1. After completing the local deployment, open the Streamlit web app using the deployment URL provided by AI Studio.
2. For additional details on how the Streamlit app works, refer to the `README.md` file in the `demo/streamlit` folder.
